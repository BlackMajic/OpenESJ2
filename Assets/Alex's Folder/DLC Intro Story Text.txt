A long time ago...

You defeated the Groove Wizard.

God, that was so hot of you.

...anyway...

Some rumblings have been heard coming from the Groove Wizard's abandoned tower.

Could it be his return?

It's time to head to the tower and check it out!

But first...

...the Boogie Bros. are having a welcome back party for you!

Hurray!
